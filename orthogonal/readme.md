An OrthogonalStateMachine, designed to handle orthogonal states within a UI development context, can be useful in a variety of scenarios:

1. **User Interfaces with Multiple Simultaneous Modes:** When your application involves multiple modes that should coexist simultaneously, an orthogonal state machine can help manage these modes independently. For example, a media player might have orthogonal states for playback controls, playlist management, and volume control.

2. **Complex Forms and Form Validation:** In a multi-step form or a wizard-like interface, orthogonal states can be used to represent different sections or steps of the form. Each section may have its own validation rules and behavior.

3. **Responsive Layouts:** For responsive web design, you might have orthogonal states to represent different layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile views. The layout and behavior can change independently based on the current viewport size.

4. **Modal Dialogs and Overlays:** If your UI involves various modals, pop-ups, or overlays, each of them could be managed as orthogonal states. This makes it easier to handle the opening, closing, and interactions within each modal.

5. **Game Interfaces:** In game development, orthogonal states can represent different gameplay modes, menus, pause screens, and in-game dialogs. Each of these modes may have unique interactions and UI components.

6. **Dashboard Interfaces:** Complex dashboards may have multiple panels that can be independently collapsed, expanded, or resized. Orthogonal states help manage these panel states.

7. **Chat Applications:** In chat applications, you can use orthogonal states to manage the chat input area, message history, user list, and other chat-related components, allowing them to evolve independently.

8. **Multi-Tenant Applications:** In multi-tenant SaaS applications, different tenants or organizations might have their own customizations. Orthogonal states can help manage these customizations and user interfaces.

Overall, an OrthogonalStateMachine provides a structured way to manage the complex interactions and state changes that can occur within a user interface. It promotes modularity and separation of concerns, making it easier to develop, maintain, and debug complex UIs.
